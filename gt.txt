Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) is important because it allows users to freely use, study, modify, and share software. This encourages collaboration, innovation, and transparency. FOSS reduces costs for individuals, institutions, and governments, improves security through open code review, and helps users avoid dependence on a single vendor. It also supports learning and skill development, especially in education and technology fields.
